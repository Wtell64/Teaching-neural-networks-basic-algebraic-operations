# Teaching-neural-networks-basic-algebraic-operations

This project was done for a deep learning course at Leiden University.

We teached RNNs the basic algebraic operations (addition and substraction).

We trained three types of networks. One where the input is a string and the output is a string as well. Second one where the input is an image and the output is a string and the last one where the input is a text and the output is an image.
